+ UTD unsupervised term detection - detect chords in a song
+ Consider Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients to extract features from time sinal https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum
+ An alternaitive to MFCC is to create a denoising auto-encoder to learn the features. To have differnent time sinals to train AE with we need DTW. State of the art is a Correspondance AE (CAE)
+ Dynamic time warping to allign signals https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping
